# Personal Website

My portfolio website where I post information about myself, my co-op terms, and projects I've made. See the current site at [dimitardimitrov.ca](https://dimitardimitrov.ca/).<br>

I used HTML/CSS with bootstrap as the foundation with javascript and jQuery to handle resizing<br>
and scrolling features.

If you want to see the source code (non-minified), you can take a look at the "develop" branch.
