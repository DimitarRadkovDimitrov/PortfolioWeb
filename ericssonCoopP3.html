                    <h5 id="theJob">The Job</h5>
                    <p>
                        For my third and final term at Ericsson I joined the integration layer
                        development team, CPI. In production, the client will interact with CPI
                        directly through its REST API. CPI then communicates with other back-end
                        services
                        to deliver the correct functionality.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        CPI uses Java coupled with a bunch of frameworks and tools for development
                        and production environments. Going into this term I was already familiar
                        with Java and the dev tools they used but I still needed to learn new
                        frameworks and how to implement them.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This term I had the opportunity to take on a solo project for an automation
                        task. I got to formally learn python and use APIs to parse and export test
                        data to Excel worksheets. It was fun to go back to CS fundamentals.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        On the other hand, I also got to work with agile methodologies in a
                        professional
                        setting through scrum which wouldn’t have been possible had I not been
                        enrolled in a co-op program.
                    </p><!-- The Job -->
                    <h5 id="goals">Goals</h5>
                    <p>
                        Most of the goals I made for this term related to learning technologies
                        that CPI was using or was going to use in the future.
                    </p><!-- Goals Intro -->
                    <h6 id="goal1">Goal 1: Depth and Breadth of Understanding</h6>
                    <p>
                        For my first project of the term I was tasked with automating the
                        extraction of test data into a human readable format. I found that the best
                        way to do this was to write a script to parse and convert this data into
                        Excel spreadsheets for analysis. This required me to learn python, and some
                        visual basic for advanced filter tables. To learn what was available in
                        python OOB I went through the entire official python tutorial for the
                        latest stable release. At the time of coding, I referred to this guide and
                        documentation for the standard library for implementation examples. This
                        ensured that my program was performant and built with best practices in
                        mind.
                    </p><!-- Goal 1 -->
                    <h6 id="goal2">Goal 2: Technological Literacy</h6>
                    <p>
                        Being the integration layer for all of Ericsson’s back-end services, CPI
                        needed a way to ensure that each service was modular and extensible. For
                        this purpose, CPI uses the OSGi framework to separate libraries into
                        bundles that expose services. OSGi is a big part of CPI architecture so I
                        needed to understand how it worked to be able to extend CPI features. OSGi
                        alliance, the organization that maintains the OSGi standard recommended
                        that developers learn by example through their enRoute series. I first went
                        through the FAQ to get a broad understanding of the system and clear up any
                        confusion upfront. I then worked my way through tutorials related to CPI
                        architecture to get a feel for what I would be working with later.
                    </p><!-- Goal 2 -->
                    <h6 id="goal3">Goal 3: Technological Literacy</h6>
                    <p>
                        During this term Ericsson’s digital services unit had some portfolio and
                        organizational restructuring. Because of this, there was some downtime
                        between projects. I took this time to expand my skillset and learn new
                        frameworks. Of particular interest to me was React-Native which allows you
                        to write cross-platform (iOS and Android) code using only JavaScript.
                        Another popular framework was Ruby on Rails which I wanted to try out as
                        well. To target my learning, I worked on a <a href="https://github.com/DimitarRadkovDimitrov/watch-list"
                            target="_blank">movie/tv
                            tracking application</a>
                        which used React-Native on the front-end and an API-only rails service on
                        the back-end. Since I was already fascinated with GraphQL, I used ruby to
                        wrap an existing REST API giving me more flexibility on the front-end when
                        querying related data. As usual, I went through each language/framework’s
                        main concepts documentation to get an initial understanding then proceeded
                        to learn as I worked.
                    </p><!-- Goal 3 -->
                    <h6 id="reflections">Reflections</h6>
                    <p>
                        <i>Goal 1 - </i> I found going through the documentation for python and
                        their standard library to be very beneficial. I learned about all the
                        built-in methods for
                        each data structure and this helped me decide the best ones to use when
                        writing the program.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <i>Goal 2 - </i>
                        While OSGi might be an older architecture, it stills makes sense for a lot
                        of use cases and so it was useful for me to learn.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <i>Goal 3 - </i>
                        Learning some of the newer frameworks was fun and helped keep me up to date
                        with the latest technologies at the time.
                    </p><!-- Reflections -->
                    <h6 id="technology">Technologies</h6>
                    <p>
                        For this term I wanted to expand my Java programming skills to be able to
                        take on more complex and challenging problems. Although I ended up doing
                        less programming in Java, I still got to develop my general programming
                        skills further and pick up some new languages on the way which was good.
                    </p><!-- Technologies -->
                    <h6 id="focus">Focus of Work Term</h6>
                    <p>
                        For this term the focus was getting accustom to agile development in the
                        real world. I’d been exposed to scrum previously through a software
                        engineering course but there were different ways of working that I needed
                        to practice to be an effective member in my team.
                    </p><!-- Focus -->
                    <h6 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h6>
                    <p>
                        Although I didn’t get to work on the main product as much as I hoped, I was
                        still able to get a taste of agile work in a professional environment. I’m
                        sure this will benefit me and future teams I work with.
                    </p><!-- Conclusion -->
                    <h6 id="acknowledgments">Acknowledgments</h6>
                    <p>
                        With this being the final term of a 12-month session at Ericsson I’d like
                        to give a huge thanks to my manager Harshad for keeping me busy throughout
                        the year and my co-op coordinator Kate for visiting and making sure I was
                        getting the most out of this experience. I would also like to thank Greg
                        Klotz and everyone at the CECS for making the exception for this 12-month
                        work term.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I got to experience both sides of the stack, build my development skills
                        further, and work in an agile development team at a large organization.
                    </p>
                    <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">
                        While I learnt a bunch, this also opened my eyes to the complexity of
                        software development and how much I need to learn and practice to become a
                        great developer. I can’t wait to keep going and see what the future has in
                        store.
