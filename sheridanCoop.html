Sheridan competes in the education sector with 3 campuses all over the Greater Toronto Area. </p><p> What makes Sheridan unique is that they effectively integrate the small class size model with industry professional instructors who balance both traditional and experimental learning. </p><h5 id="theJob">The Job</h5> <p> At Sheridan, I worked as a Java Learning Assistant. The main duties of a Learning Assistant include tutoring students one-on-one through appointments and drop-ins, helping students by participating in class sections, and leading regular study sessions to provide clarification and supplementary material. </p><p> The essential skills required for this job included: an in-depth understanding of object oriented methodologies and programming logic, strong written and verbal communication skills, and the ability to work both independently and in a group. </p><p> The knowledge/technical skills involving Java programming, written communication, and independent work ethic were all developed in class. However, verbal communication skills and the ability to work in a group setting were developed through both Sheridan and previous job experiences. </p><p> Without constant supervision, I had the opportunity to work independently. This lead me to find more ways to be more productive in my spare time while making sure my tutoring ran smoothly. I also helped run all-day events for Java programming students called Exam Crams where students ran through a pool of practice problems to help prepare them for their exam. In addition to this, there were a handful of marketing tasks such as creating online and classroom announcements, and professional posters for upcoming events. </p><p> This co-op work term had very much enhanced my academic experience. The soft skills I learned at Sheridan such as collaboration and verbal communication are not skills I could easily develop as a computer science student at Guelph. Soft skills are often overlooked with programmers so this will give me an advantage when job seeking for future terms. </p><h5 id="goals">Goals</h5> <p> This term I made 3 goals specific to skills that would benefit me in my day to day working life. Oral communication was a very important skill to develop since most of my time was spent helping students through one on one appointments and lab sessions. In addition to this, I had many opportunities to increase my knowledge in previous disciplines and learn new frameworks. </p><h6 id="goal1">Goal 1: Oral Communication</h6> <p> My first and most important goal was to become a better teacher. To better assist students I needed to improve my ability to speak in a concise and confident manner. In order to speak in such a way, I needed to have a solid understanding of the material myself. Since I usually knew the topics I was going to cover beforehand, I used my half hour of morning prep time every day to review material. </p><h6 id="goal2">Goal 2: Oral Communication</h6> <p> My second goal was also oral communication based but was centered around presentation skills. Java Learning Assistants routinely visit class sections and present short announcements about upcoming events. In addition to this they must present review material in each Java Jam (group tutoring session). Becoming a good presenter was a key to making sure students were engaged in each lesson. To do so, I needed to write down a script of what I was going to speak about and research what it meant to be an engaging presenter through resources such as Lynda.com. </p><h6 id="goal3">Goal 3: Teamwork</h6> <p> Lastly, good teamwork was vital in coordinating and conducting Java Jam sessions. So, to work on my collaborative skills, me and my fellow Java tutor set aside time every Monday to discuss the topics to cover in that week’s Java Jam and prepare accordingly. </p><h6 id="reflections">Reflections</h6> <p> Once I began implementing the action plan to my first goal, the results were instant. After spending just 30 minutes at the beginning of the day to prepare, the sessions ran a lot smoother and I was able to get information across more effectively. Overall 87% of surveyed students rated their sessions either very good or excellent. </p><p> My second goal was met to some degree but it was not completed as well as I’d hoped. Because of the strike going on, I was unable to make many classroom announcements and get the practice I wanted. </p><p> Finally, my last learning goal was also a success. Saloni and I set just 30 minutes every Monday to develop lesson plans for the Java Jams ahead. During these sessions, we would identify common topics from the week before in every class section and make practice problems to go over. Although the attendance for the Java Jams did not increase significantly, the students that attended were pleased with the value they were receiving. </p><h6 id="technology">Technologies</h6> <p> The main technology I wanted to work with was Java, specifically with the power of inheritance and polymorphism. Since I mainly tutor Java, I was able to study advanced topics at the start of the work term and learn some implementation details when helping students with their assignments. </p><p> A good portion of students that came in for tutoring needed help with web development and since I don’t have a large background in CSS and bootstrap, I spent some time between appointments learning about these technologies while making this website at the same time. </p><h6 id="focus">Focus of Work Term</h6> <p> The main focus of this term at Sheridan was making sure that first year programming students achieved a solid understanding of programming principles. By guiding students in discovering their own solutions to problems they will be well equipped to handle more difficult problems when they enter the world of business. </p><h6 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h6> <p> Overall, I’m glad I took this opportunity to work for Sheridan. Through this experience I not only learned a little bit about how the business world works but also what it means to serve others. By reading this I hope you gained some insight on the professional world and some of the different career avenues available in computer science. Thank you for reading! </p><h6 id="acknowledgments">Acknowledgments</h6> <p> First off, I’d like to thank Danielle Palombi and Rich Smith, for their collective guidance and feedback throughout this term helping me grow as an employee and a team member. </p><p> I would also like to thank Siann, Saloni, Jessica, Lauren, Morgan, and Lisa for keeping the workplace upbeat and positive while helping me solve any problems that arise. Next, I would like to thank Jeremy, Krishan, Sanchay, Sonali, Omran, and everyone else at Sheridan that made this a good experience. </p><p style="margin-bottom: 0;"> Last but not least a special thanks to Laura Gatto and Kate McRoberts for devoting themselves to helping us better our professional lives and always taking the time to check in to make sure we’re on the right path. </p></div></div></div><footer> <div class="container-fluid"> <p>Copyright &copy; 2018 <a href="http://www.dimitardimitrov.ca">Dimitar Dimitrov</a>.
