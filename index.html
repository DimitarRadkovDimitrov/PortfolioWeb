                                            Sheridan competes in the education sector with 3 campuses all over the Greater Toronto Area.

                                            What makes Sheridan unique is that they effectively integrate the small class size model with
                                            industry professional instructors who balance both traditional and experimental learning.

                                            At Sheridan, I worked as a Java Learning Assistant. The main duties of a Learning Assistant include
                                            tutoring students one-on-one through appointments and drop-ins, helping students by participating
                                            in class sections, and leading regular study sessions to provide clarification and supplementary
                                            material.
                                        </p>

                                        <p>
                                            The essential skills required for this job included: an in-depth understanding of object oriented
                                            methodologies and programming logic, strong written and verbal communication skills, and the ability
                                            to work both independently and in a group.
                                        </p>

                                        <p>
                                            The knowledge/technical skills involving Java programming,
                                            written communication, and independent work ethic were all developed in class. However, verbal
                                            communication skills and the ability to work in a group setting were developed through both Sheridan
                                            and previous job experiences.
                                        </p>

                                        <p>
                                            Without constant supervision, I had the opportunity to work independently.
                                            This lead me to find more ways to be more productive in my spare time while making sure my tutoring
                                            ran smoothly. I also helped run all-day events for Java programming students called Exam Crams where
                                            students ran through a pool of practice problems to help prepare them for their exam. In addition to
                                            this, there were a handful of marketing tasks such as creating online and classroom announcements,
                                            and professional posters for upcoming events.
                                        </p>

                                        <p>
                                            This co-op work term had very much enhanced my academic experience. The soft skills I learned at
                                            Sheridan such as collaboration and verbal communication are not skills I could easily develop as a
                                            computer science student at Guelph. Soft skills are often overlooked with programmers so this will
                                            give me an advantage when job seeking for future terms.

                                            This term I made 3 goals specific to skills that would benefit me in my day to day working life.
                                            Oral communication was a very important skill to develop since most of my time was spent helping
                                            students through one on one appointments and lab sessions. In addition to this, I had many
                                            opportunities to increase my knowledge in previous disciplines and learn new frameworks.
                                        </p>

                                        <p>
                                            My first and most important goal was to become a better teacher. To better assist students I needed
                                            to improve my ability to speak in a concise and confident manner. In order to speak in such a way,
                                            I needed to have a solid understanding of the material myself. Since I usually knew the topics I was
                                            going to cover beforehand, I used my half hour of morning prep time every day to review material.
                                        </p>

                                        <p>
                                            My second goal was also oral communication based but was centered around presentation skills.
                                            Java Learning Assistants routinely visit class sections and present short announcements about
                                            upcoming events. In addition to this they must present review material in each Java Jam
                                            (group tutoring session). Becoming a good presenter was a key to making sure students were engaged
                                            in each lesson. To do so, I needed to write down a script of what I was going to speak about and
                                            research what it meant to be an engaging presenter through resources such as Lynda.com.
                                        </p>

                                        <p>
                                            Lastly, good teamwork was vital in coordinating and conducting Java Jam sessions. So, to work on
                                            my collaborative skills, me and my fellow Java tutor set aside time every Monday to discuss the
                                            topics to cover in that week’s Java Jam and prepare accordingly.
                                        </p>

                                        <b>Reflections</b>
                                        <p>
                                            Once I began implementing the action plan to my first goal, the results were instant. After spending
                                            just 30 minutes at the beginning of the day to prepare, the sessions ran a lot smoother and I was able
                                            to get information across more effectively. Overall 87% of surveyed students rated their sessions either
                                            very good or excellent.
                                        </p>

                                        <p>
                                            My second goal was met to some degree but it was not completed as well as I’d hoped. Because of the
                                            strike going on, I was unable to make many classroom announcements and get the practice I wanted.
                                        </p>

                                            Finally, my last learning goal was also a success. Saloni and I set just 30 minutes every Monday to
                                            develop lesson plans for the Java Jams ahead. During these sessions, we would identify common topics
                                            from the week before in every class section and make practice problems to go over. Although the attendance
                                            for the Java Jams did not increase significantly, the students that attended were pleased with the value
                                            they were receiving.
                                        </p>

                                        <p>
                                            The main technology I wanted to work with was Java, specifically with the power of inheritance
                                            and polymorphism. Since I mainly tutor Java, I was able to study advanced topics at the start of
                                            the work term and learn some implementation details when helping students with their assignments.
                                        </p>

                                        <p>
                                            A good portion of students that came in for tutoring needed help with web development and since
                                            I don’t have a large background in CSS and bootstrap, I spent some time between appointments
                                            learning about these technologies while making this website at the same time.

                                            The main focus of this term at Sheridan was making sure that first year programming students
                                            achieved a solid understanding of programming principles. By guiding students in discovering
                                            their own solutions to problems they will be well equipped to handle more difficult problems
                                            when they enter the world of business.

                                            only learned a little bit about how the business world works but also what it means to serve others.

                                            First off, I’d like to thank Danielle Palombi and Rich Smith, for their collective guidance and
                                            feedback throughout this term helping me grow as an employee and a team member.

                                        <p>
                                            I would also like to thank Siann, Saloni, Jessica, Lauren, Morgan, and Lisa for keeping the
                                            workplace upbeat and positive while helping me solve any problems that arise. Next, I would
                                            like to thank Jeremy, Krishan, Sanchay, Sonali, Omran, and everyone else at Sheridan that made
                                            this a good experience.
