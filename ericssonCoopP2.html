                    <h5 id="theJob">The Job</h5>
                    <p>
                        For my second term at Ericsson I was tasked with reducing the JSON payload
                        for a business use case by selecting only requested data. After some
                        research I found that GraphQL had the best OOB solution for data filtering,
                        so we focused on this specific framework.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For this project I needed an intermediate-level knowledge of Java to
                        understand and expand upon the existing codebase. My Java skills have come
                        mostly from university courses however self-study and work from previous
                        terms has also played a role.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In addition to Java, I needed to be able to understand and manipulate JSON
                        data. I learned this skill on the job fairly quickly having been given the
                        Gson library to use.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        By far the most satisfying part of my job this term was being able to see
                        the expected response after trying to implement a new feature. I assume
                        that this very experience is what backend web developers live for.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This term has definitely enhanced my academic experience. Coming out of 3rd
                        year I had no idea how applications in the real world worked. This term has
                        opened up a lot of avenues for learning and I look forward to implementing
                        some of the stuff I learned into my own projects.
                    </p><!-- The Job -->
                    <h5 id="goals">Goals</h5>
                    <p>
                        Most of the work I did for this term was done for a GraphQL prototype so
                        the goals I chose were focused heavily on learning the framework and
                        programming.
                    </p><!-- Goals Intro -->
                    <h6 id="goal1">Goal 1: Depth and Breadth of Understanding</h6>
                    <p>
                        To integrate GraphQL into the existing codebase I first needed to
                        understand Ericsson’s current architecture and evaluate the best
                        implementation for this tool given the project’s requirements. To do so I
                        went through Ericsson’s documentation to try and understand the
                        architecture from a high-level. I then worked with my supervisor to design
                        an implementation of GraphQL that best suit Ericsson’s needs. Ultimately
                        the goal was to determine an implementation of this framework that was;
                        easy to integrate and maintain, satisfied requirements, and beneficial for
                        the end-user.
                    </p><!-- Goal 1 -->
                    <h6 id="goal2">Goal 2: Technological Literacy</h6>
                    <p>
                        My second goal was also GraphQL related but catered to the actual
                        implementation of the framework. Once I had an idea for the design, I
                        needed to learn the entire GraphQL domain to understand its capabilities.
                        Facebook made this easy for me by separating the implementation of the tool
                        from its functionality. They had an entire site dedicated to learning
                        framework concepts then links directing to programming specific
                        documentation. From there I could experiment with simple web applications
                        to get a full picture of the framework. In the end I would use this
                        documentation as a reference when integrating the prototype in Ericsson
                        software.
                    </p><!-- Goal 2 -->
                    <h6 id="goal3">Goal 3: Technological Literacy</h6>
                    <p>
                        The team that I worked in uses a tool called Gerrit so the final goal for
                        this term was to develop a working proficiency with it. Gerrit is code
                        review extension software that builds on top of git. This tool is very
                        important in Ericsson’s development workflow as it helps ensure the
                        production of quality code. I used it in the making of the GraphQL POC, but
                        my knowledge of the tool was not at an everyday-use proficiently. There was
                        a good amount of documentation for Gerrit and a bunch of highly specific
                        questions on StackOverflow so I never had a problem when looking for
                        resources.
                    </p><!-- Goal 3 -->
                    <h6 id="reflections">Reflections</h6>
                    <p>
                        Doing the upfront legwork to design a viable implementation for GraphQL was
                        a must. It was good practice for general software engineering skill and
                        helped keep Ericsson’s API clean.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Initially there was a lot of confusion as to what GraphQL could do OOB as
                        well as how it operated in general. Luckily for me everything seemed to
                        clear up as I read along and tested features.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For my last goal I didn’t end up doing the upfront learning like I proposed
                        in my original planning. Instead I chose to use just-in-time learning and
                        referenced documentation/StackOverflow whenever I encountered an issue with
                        Gerrit. I found this to be more efficient given that the tool was such a
                        small part of the development process.
                    </p><!-- Reflections -->
                    <h6 id="technology">Technologies</h6>
                    <p>
                        For this project I wanted to work with GraphQL and Java. In general, I
                        wanted to learn more about web services and RESTful APIs since they’re the
                        foundation behind most modern software. I’m glad that I got the opportunity
                        to do exactly that and I look forward to learning much more.

                        As you can probably tell the focus of this report was on the GraphQL
                        software developed by Facebook. It covers an abundance of technical use
                        cases and thus holds a lot of potential for web development as a whole. I
                        can’t wait to dig in further.

                    <h6 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h6>
                    <p>
                        This term I worked on the backend portion of the stack which I ended up
                        enjoying more than the front-end.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        On the more theoretical part of software engineering I practiced evaluating
                        the impacts of making changes to an established codebase.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        On the practical side I got experience integrating a third-party package
                        and running performance tests to evaluate effects.
