                <h1 class="sectionHeader">Work Term 2: Ericsson</h1>
                <h5 id="info">About Ericsson</h5>
                <p>
                    For my second, third, and fourth work-term I worked at Ericsson. Ericsson is a
                    huge player in the global economy's information and communications technology (ICT)
                    sector serving around 40% of the world's mobile traffic through their networks.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To complement their telecommunications hardware, Ericsson supports service providers
                    with application development and maintenance for network and operations management
                    and customer and revenue management.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As a company they have around 100,000 employees worldwide with offices in Toronto,
                    Brazil, and India. I worked at Ericsson's Toronto office where the focus is on
                    research and development for software.
                </p>
                <h5 id="theJob">The Job</h5>
                <p>
                    My position at Ericsson was as a Software Developer intern. The initial project I was
                    involved in was the proof of concept (POC) for a potential Ericsson-Salesforce integration.
                    The aim of this project was to see how technically feasible this integration was. This
                    project involved a lot of research to see what was possible when developing using
                    Salesforce's frameworks as well as some front-end development on my side to emulate
                    an actual business use case.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For this project I needed to have a good understanding of Java given that Salesforce's apex
                    was very similar. I also needed to have a basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
                    to be able to learn other front-end frameworks. Aside from programming languages I needed
                    to be able to develop responsive websites that catered to different screen resolutions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My knowledge of Java and object-oriented programming comes from courses I've taken at Guelph
                    and self-study done at Sheridan, but the learning of web design fundamentals was done with
                    projects outside of class. These skills then improved with application on the job.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What was unique about this job was the absolute autonomy I got to experience in my day to day
                    working life. Aside from regular meetings I had full control over my schedule which gave me
                    the freedom to learn and work at my own pace. I also had the opportunity to demo the prototype
                    to a team at Ericsson, showing them what was built and answering their questions about the
                    framework I used.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The ability to clearly communicate your thoughts is a great asset in the workplace and I'm glad
                    that I got more practice with this skill.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With this work term I also caught a glimpse of the complexity behind large enterprise software
                    and the importance of expert skill in large organizations. This helped reinforce the idea of
                    continuous and efficient learning.
                </p>
                <h5 id="goals">Goals</h5>
                <p>
                    The goals I chose for the first 4 months at Ericsson had mostly to do with learning and overall
                    work efficiency, both of which are valuable skills that can be used for following work terms and
                    my career down the line. With these initial skills, I would be able to learn and apply quickly,
                    gaining more knowledge and marketable skills.
                </p>
                <h6 id="goal1">Goal 1: Technological Literacy</h6>
                <p>
                    Working on the front-end of an Ericsson-Salesforce integration prototype, I needed to learn how
                    to use Salesforce's lightning components framework to help build a sample catalog searching
                    application for products. Learning this framework as well as the basics of JavaScript became
                    my first goal. Luckily, Salesforce had a great interactive learning resource available for each
                    of their frameworks called trailhead. As for JavaScript, I went through Lynda.com's JavaScript
                    Essentials Training to help get me up to speed. Of course, I also learned as I went along but
                    these resources gave me a good base to work off of.
                </p>
                <h6 id="goal2">Goal 2: Information Literacy</h6>
                <p>
                    My second goal had more to do with my efficiency in learning new frameworks. I wanted to become
                    better at extracting relevant information from my resources to streamline development. This meant
                    going through a little algorithm for what to do when I hit a wall. I would work through a problem
                    for at least 15-20 minutes before looking for a solution on the internet or asking a colleague for
                    help. After this block of time, I would go through the best resources I could find (for example
                    Salesforce's Stack Exchange or documentation). After which if I still couldn't find a solution I
                    could seek help from relevant experts at Ericsson.
                </p>
                <h6 id="goal3">Goal 3: Personal Organization</h6>
                <p>
                    My final goal was to achieve better overall working efficiency by scheduling and executing tasks
                    at the daily and weekly level. This would make sure that any given assignment is completed as fast
                    as possible with time to spare to ensure quality of work. I would start on Monday by planning tasks
                    for the week and perhaps the following week if there was a big deadline looming. Then on the daily
                    level I would come in every morning and use 5-10 minutes to take the day's tasks and spread them
                    throughout my working hours in time blocks.
                </p>
                <h6 id="reflections">Reflections</h6>
                <p>
                    Going through these learning resources before I started programming ended up being a good idea.
                    I was able to go through the entire project with minimal debugging.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My second goal is still a work in progress. Not knowing the cause of an issue can be an uncomfortable
                    feeling that can give the urge to search google at the first sign of trouble.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My final learning goal was a success as I was able to get back into the routine of planning and
                    scheduling my day. At the very least this habit gives me a sense of direction for the day and minimizes
                    the stress of disorganization.
                </p>
                <h6 id="technology">Technologies</h6>
                <p>
                    Coming into Ericsson I wanted to work with Java once again given that I'm a huge fan of object-oriented
                    programming. But I ended up doing more front-end development with some exposure to Salesforce's server-side
                    language apex.
                </p>
                <p>
                    All things considered, the knowledge of a front-end framework is always valuable to a software developer so
                    I'm glad I got to learn something new while expanding my existing skills in HTML and CSS. I can always apply
                    these skills to my website and future projects.
                </p>
                <h6 id="focus">Focus of Work Term</h6>
                <p>
                    I would say that the focus of this 4-month term was to start to find parts of software development that I
                    didn't like to do very much. I found that although I would get better at UI and front-end development, I
                    didn't find it any more interesting.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The problem solving using data structures and algorithms that backend development has to offer appeals
                    more to me and will likely be more gratifying. I do think that knowledge of one or two popular front-end
                    frameworks will always be useful, however I need to give more thought to specialization as I go along.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The great thing about co-op is that it allows you to play around and have this feeling out process where
                    you can see what you like and don't like early in your career where there aren't really any real consequences.
                </p>
                <h6 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h6>
                <p>
                    My first work term at Ericsson was a pleasant experience. I learned a little bit about how a large software system works, gained some knowledge of microservice architecture, and picked up a new front-end framework.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I also couldn't help but notice the importance of self-learning and picking things up quickly. You need
                    to be constantly learning and evolving after college/university, so having this skill is of upmost importance.
                    This is definitely one that I want to keep developing as I go through my career.
                </p>
                <h6 id="acknowledgments">Acknowledgments</h6>
                <p>
                    I would first like to thank my manager Ryoshi and my onboarding buddy/project architect Samer for helping me
                    get up and running and always being available for help.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I would also like to thank my team members Carl, Thiago, Moises, and Kedar for taking the time to teach, guide,
                    and provide support when problems arose.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A special thanks to Greg Klotz, Kate McRoberts, Laura Gatto, and everyone at the CEC that made this 12-month
                    term possible.
                </p>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">
                    PS - Greg I'm sorry for all the emails about graduation requirements
